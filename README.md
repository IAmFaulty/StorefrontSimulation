# How It's Made:
Tech used: C# and Unity Engine

I started from scratch, having never made a program in C# nor in Unity. I made the image assets and code assets myself after spending a few hours in the unredempting tutorial hell. Eventually, I got a prototype working that allows different customers to pass by the shop, with the next developments being to allow customers to enter the shop and make purchases, as well as an expected customer turnout to determine the final profits after comparing it to the overhead costs. Progress is still underway!

# Lessons Learned:
Never enter tutorial hell. It ended up wasting a lot of my time that I otherwise could've spent looking for answers and troubleshooting myself. Rarely did I find the answers without first prodding at the problem to see what was wrong in the first place, and that's what I've learned is better to do now.
